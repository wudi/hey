# PHP OOP Features Implementation Plan

## Status Overview (Updated: 2024)

Based on comprehensive testing, here is the current status of PHP OOP features in hey-codex:

### ‚úÖ Working Features

1. **Basic Classes and Objects** - WORKING
   - Class declaration and instantiation
   - Public properties and methods
   - Constructor (`__construct`)
   - Basic inheritance (`extends`)
   - Method overriding
   - Parameter passing (fixed)

2. **Access Modifiers** - WORKING
   - `public`, `protected`, `private` properties and methods
   - Proper access control enforcement

3. **Static Methods and Properties** - WORKING
   - Static property access (`Class::$property`)
   - Static method calls (`Class::method()`)
   - `parent::`, `self::` keyword support
   - Late static binding (`static::`) - WORKING

4. **Class Constants** - WORKING
   - Class constant declaration and access
   - `self::CONSTANT` access
   - Late static binding for constants (`static::CONSTANT`) - WORKING

5. **Final Classes and Methods** - WORKING
   - `final` keyword enforcement
   - Proper inheritance blocking

6. **Interfaces** - WORKING
   - Interface declaration and implementation
   - `implements` keyword
   - Interface method enforcement

7. **Traits** - WORKING
   - Trait declaration and usage
   - `use` statement
   - Trait method inclusion
   - Parameter passing and `$this` binding (fixed)

8. **Object Cloning** - WORKING
   - `clone` operator
   - `__clone` magic method invocation (fixed)
   - Shallow copy with property modification

9. **instanceof Operator** - WORKING
   - Type checking with inheritance support
   - Proper inheritance chain validation

10. **Magic Methods** - WORKING
    - `__get`, `__set` - Working
    - `__toString` - Working
    - `__invoke` - Working
    - `__call`, `__callStatic` - Working
    - `__clone` - Working (fixed)
    - `__destruct` - Working (implemented)

11. **Destructor** - WORKING
    - `__destruct` methods called on unset() and script end
    - Automatic cleanup with duplicate prevention
    - Proper object lifecycle management

12. **Magic Constants** - WORKING
    - `__CLASS__` returns current class name (WORKING)
    - `__METHOD__` returns Class::method or function name (WORKING)
    - `__FUNCTION__` returns function/method name (WORKING)
    - `__FILE__` returns absolute file path (WORKING)
    - `__LINE__` returns current line number (WORKING)
    - `__DIR__` returns file directory (WORKING)

13. **Abstract Classes** - WORKING
    - Abstract classes cannot be instantiated (properly prevented)
    - Abstract method enforcement works correctly
    - Declaration and inheritance work

### ‚ùå Missing Features

*All major PHP OOP features have been implemented and are working correctly.*

### üîß Partially Working Features

## Implementation Tasks

### ‚úÖ Completed Tasks

1. **Static Method Calls** - COMPLETED
2. **instanceof Operator** - COMPLETED
3. **Interfaces** - COMPLETED
4. **Traits** - COMPLETED (including parameter passing fix)
5. **Object Cloning** - COMPLETED (including `__clone` invocation)
6. **Magic Methods** - COMPLETED (all major ones working)
7. **Destructor Calls** - COMPLETED (including lifecycle management)
8. **Abstract Class Instantiation Prevention** - COMPLETED
9. **Class Magic Constants** - COMPLETED (`__CLASS__`, `__METHOD__`, `__FUNCTION__`)
10. **File Magic Constants** - COMPLETED (`__FILE__`, `__LINE__`, `__DIR__`)
11. **Abstract Method Enforcement** - COMPLETED
12. **Late Static Binding** - COMPLETED (`static::` keyword for constants and method calls)

### Phase 1: Core Fixes (Priority: HIGH)

All core fixes completed!

### Phase 2: Magic Constants (Priority: LOW)

#### Task 2.1: Implement Class Magic Constants - COMPLETED ‚úÖ

#### Task 2.2: Implement File Magic Constants - COMPLETED ‚úÖ

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (Priority: LOW)

#### Task 3.1: Late Static Binding
- **Keyword**: `static::`
- **Dependencies**: Runtime class resolution

**Implementation Steps**:
1. Track calling class context at runtime
2. Resolve `static::` to actual calling class
3. Differentiate from `self::` (compile-time binding)
4. Support in method calls and property access

### Phase 4: Advanced Features (Priority: LOW)

#### Task 4.1: Anonymous Classes
- **Opcode**: New opcode needed
- **Implementation**: Full parser and compiler support

#### Task 4.2: Late Static Binding
- **Keyword**: `static::`
- **Dependencies**: Static context tracking

#### Task 4.3: Type Declarations
- **Feature**: Typed properties and parameters
- **Dependencies**: Type system improvements

## Testing Strategy

### Comprehensive Test Suite
Create individual test files for each feature:
- `test_static_methods.php`
- `test_interfaces_complete.php`
- `test_traits_complete.php`
- `test_instanceof_fix.php`
- `test_clone_complete.php`
- `test_magic_methods_complete.php`

### Regression Testing
Ensure all currently working features continue to work after each implementation.

## Recommended Implementation Order

1. **Abstract Class Instantiation Fix** (Proper OOP enforcement)
2. **Class Magic Constants** (Debugging and reflection)
3. **File Magic Constants** (File context awareness)
4. **Late Static Binding** (Advanced inheritance feature)

## Success Criteria

- All test cases pass without errors
- PHP compatibility verified against standard PHP interpreter
- Core OOP features work reliably
- Memory management handles object lifecycle properly

---

**Status**: **COMPLETE** - All major PHP OOP features have been successfully implemented and are working correctly. The hey-codex PHP interpreter now supports the full range of core PHP OOP functionality.
