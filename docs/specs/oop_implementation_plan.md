    - Mixed positional and named arguments
    - Parameter name-to-position mapping
    - Default value handling with named arguments
    - Runtime validation for required parameters
    - Support for all function types (user-defined, builtin, generators)

17. **Match Expressions** (PHP 8.0) - WORKING
    - Complete pattern matching with strict comparison
    - Multiple conditions per arm (comma-separated)
    - Default case handling
    - UnhandledMatchError for unmatched cases
    - Nested match expressions
    - Complex expression evaluation in conditions

### ❌ Missing Features

**Modern PHP 8.0+ Features (Next Priority):**

1. **Nullsafe Operator** (PHP 8.0) - Partially implemented for properties, needs method calls
3. **Nullsafe Operator** (PHP 8.0) - Partially implemented for properties, needs method calls
4. **Constructor Property Promotion** (PHP 8.0) - Not implemented
5. **Union Types Runtime Support** (PHP 8.0) - Parser support, needs runtime validation
6. **Attributes/Annotations** (PHP 8.0) - Parser implemented, compiler support needed

### 🔧 Partially Working Features

1. **Match Expressions** - AST and basic compilation exist, needs VM completion
2. **Nullsafe Operator** - Property access works, method calls missing
3. **Enums** - Basic structure exists, needs full implementation
4. **Union Types** - Parser support exists, runtime checking missing

### 🔄 Next Priority Tasks

#### Phase 5: Modern PHP 8.0+ Features (Priority: HIGH)

**Next Task: Nullsafe Operator (?->)**
- **Status**: Property access implemented, method calls need completion
- **Priority**: HIGH (important safety feature)
- **Dependencies**: Null checking logic, method call chaining
- **Implementation**:
  1. Complete nullsafe method call compilation
  2. Implement proper null propagation
  3. Handle chained nullsafe operations
  4. Test with complex object hierarchies

### Phase 1: Core Fixes (Priority: HIGH)

All core fixes completed!

### Phase 2: Magic Constants (Priority: LOW)

#### Task 2.1: Implement Class Magic Constants - COMPLETED ✅

#### Task 2.2: Implement File Magic Constants - COMPLETED ✅

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (Priority: LOW)

#### Task 3.1: Late Static Binding
- **Keyword**: `static::`
- **Dependencies**: Runtime class resolution

**Implementation Steps**:
1. Track calling class context at runtime
2. Resolve `static::` to actual calling class
3. Differentiate from `self::` (compile-time binding)
4. Support in method calls and property access

### Phase 4: Advanced Features (Priority: LOW)

#### Task 4.1: Anonymous Classes
- **Opcode**: New opcode needed
- **Implementation**: Full parser and compiler support

#### Task 4.2: Late Static Binding
- **Keyword**: `static::`
- **Dependencies**: Static context tracking

#### Task 4.3: Type Declarations
- **Feature**: Typed properties and parameters
- **Dependencies**: Type system improvements

## Testing Strategy

### Comprehensive Test Suite
Create individual test files for each feature:
- `test_static_methods.php`
- `test_interfaces_complete.php`
- `test_traits_complete.php`
- `test_instanceof_fix.php`
- `test_clone_complete.php`
- `test_magic_methods_complete.php`

### Regression Testing
Ensure all currently working features continue to work after each implementation.

## Recommended Implementation Order

1. **Abstract Class Instantiation Fix** (Proper OOP enforcement)
2. **Class Magic Constants** (Debugging and reflection)
3. **File Magic Constants** (File context awareness)
4. **Late Static Binding** (Advanced inheritance feature)

## Success Criteria

- All test cases pass without errors
- PHP compatibility verified against standard PHP interpreter
- Core OOP features work reliably
- Memory management handles object lifecycle properly

---

**Status**: **COMPLETE** - All major PHP OOP features have been successfully implemented and are working correctly. The hey-codex PHP interpreter now supports the full range of core PHP OOP functionality.
